# hurbIndustries openMoto
### What is it?
openMoto is a firmware for building homemade ECUs for EFI/Carbureted engines. It's written primarily for Arduinos; designed to be easily scalable and modular.

### Why? What about any alternatives?
This project was started not to reinvent the wheel. This is primarily done as a learning experience.

### Modular? How so?
CAN! Any boards that are being designed will be made with CAN bus support in mind, both external and internally; allowing for easy communications between different computer modules?

## Roadmap...
- [ ] Mk1 Gauge Cluster module.
- [ ] Central Data Unit.
- [ ] PCB designs
- [ ] Unit CADs.

## Can I help?
Absolutely. Please feel free to fork and make a pull request with any new features!
